## Roadmap Maintenance
These Rodamaps are living documents and require scheduled grooming to remain accurate and reliable.

### Weekly Upkeep
Following roadmap check-ins during the Weekly Gisida Team Meetings, the Roadmap Tables should be updated as necessary.

### Quarterly Upkeep
Following Quarterly Roadmap Meetings the Quarterly Roadmap Tables must be updated:
* Copy incomplete stories to the next quarter with their current status
* In the new Quarterly Table, prepend the Story status with ⤵️ to denote it was copied from a previous quarter
* In the old Quarterly Table, set the status of incomplete stories to ⤵️, denoting it as copied to the next quarter
* Add Stories to the new Quarterly Table as agreed upon in the Quarterly Roadmap Meeting
