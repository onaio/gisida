# Gisida Roadmaps
* [2020](./2020.md)

## Roadmap Structure

### Quarterly Tables
Pulling heavily from [SRE](https://github.com/onaio/playbooks/blob/master/docs/roadmaps/2020.md) and [Canopy](https://github.com/onaio/canopy/blob/master/docs/roadmaps/2020.md) roadmaps our quarterly tables pshould be structured with the columns:

* Hemisphere
  * 🐋 Client - Stories which are client centric
  * 🐃 Core - Stories which are core centric
  * 🦄 Core for Client - Stories which require core updates for a client

* Status
  * ❌ Not Started
  * 🔨 In Progress
  * 🚧 Blocked
  * ✅ Complete
  * ⤵️ Moved to Next Quarter
  * 🛑 Removed from Roadmap

* Thematic Areas
  * Comma separated list of Goals the Story works towards

* Story
  * The name of the story
  * Linked to tickets / milestones

* Owners
  * 🆘 Needs Assignment
  * Comma separated initials of collaborators leading the story

## Roadmap Maintenance
These Rodamaps are living documents and require scheduled grooming to remain accurate and reliable.

### Weekly Upkeep
Following roadmap check-ins during the Weekly Gisida Team Meetings, the Roadmap Tables should be updated as necessary.

### Quarterly Upkeep
Following Quarterly Roadmap Meetings the Quarterly Roadmap Tables must be updated:
* Copy incomplete stories to the next quarter with their current status
* In the new Quarterly Table, prepend the Story status with ⤵️ to denote it was copied from a previous quarter
* In the old Quarterly Table, set the status of incomplete stories to ⤵️, denoting it as copied to the next quarter
* Add Stories to the new Quarterly Table as agreed upon in the Quarterly Roadmap Meeting
