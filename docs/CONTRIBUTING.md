## Branch naming

A branch is named by separating various parts with a forward slash. The structure of a branch name is as follows

`group-token/issue-number_awesome-branch-name`

e.g **feature/300_layer-builder**

The following are tokens that can be used and their meaning:

**bug**: Malfunctions that should be fixed to comply with the expected behaviour

**enhancement**: Improvement of an existing feature

**feature**: A new feature

## Creating an issue

### Before creating an issue

- Use the search feature to make sure there issue doesnâ€™t already exist. If this does happen though, close the less thorough issue and include a comment e.g **Duplicate of #123**

### How do I create a good issue?

- Keep the titles short and descriptive. Have the specific details in the issue descripion.

- Avoid issues that contain too much detail. Split a complex issue.

- Mention relevant people _@username_ if necessary.

- Add information that can help clarify the issue e.g screenshots of Javascript errors and warnings.

- In case of a bug, give as details as possible of how to reproduce the bug and the expected behaviour.

## Don't Do

- Don't create a merge request if your source branch has commented out code.

- Don't use long and descriptive names when creating issues and pull requests.
